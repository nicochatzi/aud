# `api` 

Except `aud/`, each directory contains an `api.lua` file
that describes the API that specific `aud` subcommand will parse.

There are additional example scripts.

## `aud/`

This is a Lua package that `aud` has pre-loaded.
All the public functions and variables are
available to your scripts used by `aud`.
